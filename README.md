# Render3D

We found a photograph ([Figure 1](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Render3D/blob/main/images/reference1.jpg)) taken in Seoul, Korea at SMTown Building by photographer noealz. The photograph was taken at night, and has various light sources and nice light reflections in the scene(e.g. LED screens on buildings and light reflections on wet streets).

Our goal is to build our computer graphics image based on this photograph but with more creative objects displayed in the scene. We would like to substitute the original LED screen into an illuminating water tank as in [Figure 2](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Render3D/blob/main/images/reference2.jpg) and add some sea animals like blue whale in the water tank.
